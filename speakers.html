<h3><a name="atornhill">Beyond code: Repository mining with Clojure</a></h3>
<p>To understand large legacy systems we need to look beyond the current structure of the code. We need to understand both how the system evolves and how the people building it collaborate. In this session you'll learn about a Clojure application to mine social information such as communication paths, developer knowledge and hotspots from source code repositories (including Clojure itself). It's information you use to improve both the design and the people-side of your codebase. We'll also look at some interesting libraries like Incanter and Instaparse before we discuss the pros and cons of writing the tool in Clojure.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Adam combines degrees in engineering and psychology to get a different perspective on the challenges of software. In his role as software consultant, he works as both an architect and a programmer. Adam also writes open-source software in a variety of programming languages. He's the author of Your Code as a Crime Scene, has written the popular Lisp for the Web tutorial, and self-published a book on Patterns in C. His other interests include modern history, music and martial arts.</p></div>

<p>Clojure-Android initiative is a group of tools and people that aim to make Clojure a first-class language for Android development. It is almost four years old now, and during these years it evolved from being a small hobby project into an ecosystem that some companies use professionally. This talk will present the current state of Clojure-Android, explain why and in what areas Clojure is better than Java for Android development and give a brief overview of Clojure-Android tools and libraries. It will also feature Project Skummet, an optimizing Clojure compiler for both JVM and Android, that can make an application load 3-4 times faster. The talk will conclude with a short demo where a very simple Clojure-Android app is created step by step.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> My name is Alexander Yakushev, currently a postgraduate at Gjøvik University College. I'm the maintainer of Clojure-Android (CoA) initiative, under which I (co)developed a few projects: a CoA build tool, a toolkit library for idiomatic CoA development, developer tooling etc. I participated in three Google Summer of Codes on Clojure/dev behalf, two years working on CoA, and last year created Project Skummet - an optimizing compiler for Clojure for both JVM and Android.</p></div>

<h3><a name="mmarczyk">Ctries in Clojure; or, concurrent transients</a></h3>
<p>The ability of persistent data structures to participate in complex version graphs where many independent instances of a data structure are derived from a single original through the application of various update-like operations is crucial to many of the benefits that they bring to our day-to-day programming in Clojure.</p><p>Ctries, presented by Prokopec, Bronson, Bagwell and Odersky, bring this ability to the world of concurrently modifiable data structures. In addition, they are lock-free ("global progress guaranteed") and admit constant-time snapshots; and under the hood, they bear a striking resemblance to Clojure's transients.</p><p>This talk aims to examine some of the more interesting aspects of Ctries' inner workings and their relationship to the data structures built-in to Clojure, and to describe the API choices made by ctries.clj to make using them feel natural in Clojure.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Long-time contributor to all parts of ClojureScript, including the compiler and the core library; most notably, author of the ClojureScript ports of the persistent map and set types and PDS-related functionality such as transients.

<p>The talk will discuss how property-based testing compares to traditional testing methods and demonstrate its principles on simple examples. We will also see how does it fit into a TDD workflow. In order to bust the myth of inapplicability of property-based testing in a real-world setting we'll bring up some use cases from the industry. Afterwards we'll move on from immutable, static properties to a more dynamic setting. We'll see how tools present in the Clojure ecosystem allow us to validate stateful computations through generation of test scenarios. Finally, we'll wander into the world of concurrency and automation of race conditions detection.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Jan is a backend developer at stylefruits.

<h3><a name="dnolen">Om Next</a></h3>
<p>Over the past year and a half the ClojureScript community has collectively become the industry's leading experts on building
effective and compelling user experiences over immutable data. However, while immutability and functional programming
dramatically reduce the complexity of client side code there is more work left to do, especially at the boundary between clients and
servers. There are a growing set of technologies and ideas that can complete the story that deserve assessment. We'll examine Relay
(Facebook), JSONGraph (Netflix), and Datomic (Cognitect) and see how these technologies are guiding the design of the next version of Om,
a popular React binding for ClojureScript.</p>

<p>A deep understanding of Clojure, how it executes, and the runtime it sits on is a whole lot of work to acquire. But there's a shortcut. Doing performance work forces you to peel apart the layers of abstraction your software sits on, and understand what really goes on. This is an exploration of war stories from performance tuning a production Clojure application, with an eye towards surprising lessons about Clojure and the runtime it executes on: the JVM.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Tom Crayford has been using Clojure since before Leiningen was released.

<p>Often times your business logic relies on remote data that you need to fetch from different sources: databases, caches, web services or 3rd party APIs, and you can't mess things up. You need to keep your business logic clear of low-level details while performing efficiently: fetching data in parallel, batching requests, handling failures, retries, and so forth. There are a few projects that aim to solve this problem: Haxl (open-source Haskell library from Facebook) and Stitch (Scala library from Twitter, not open-sourced yet but a few talks are available). Both projects give you the ability to access remote data sources in a concise and consistent way, while the library handles batching and overlapping requests to multiple data sources behind the scenes. How can you solve the same problem with Clojure code? In this talk we'll go over concrete examples and see how to achieve the same results with Clojure.</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> CTO at Attendify.

<p>Relational programming, or logic programming, is a paradigm that exhibits remarkable and powerful properties, to the extent that its implementation seems frightfully daunting to the layman. &mu;Kanren is a minimal relational language that seeks to strip the paradigm down to its core, leaving us with a succinct and elegant set of primitives on top of which we can rebuild even the most powerful relational constructs.</p><p>In this talk, we will explore the &mu;Kanren language by implementing it from first principles in a simple functional programming language, going on to demonstrate how you can assemble these simple building blocks into a semblance of its richer parent, miniKanren, and maybe solve a logic puzzle or two to make sure it's working as advertised.</p><p>The &mu;Kanren paper, and the original &mu;Kanren implementation, were authored by Jason Hemann and Daniel P. Friedman. The paper is available at http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf, and the Scheme implementation at https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren</p><div class="bio"><p><b>About the speaker:</b> Born into an aristocratic Russian-German family, Bodil traveled widely around the Soviet Union as a child. Largely self-educated, she developed an interest in computer science during her teenage years. According to her later claims, in 1989 she embarked on a series of world travels, visiting Europe, the Americas, and India. She alleged that during this period she encountered a group of mathematical adepts, the "Haskell Language and Library Committee," who sent her to Glasgow, Scotland, where they trained her to develop her powers of category theory. Both contemporary critics and later biographers have argued that some or all of these foreign visits were fictitious, and that she spent this period writing JavaScript.</p><p>Bodil was a controversial figure during her lifetime, championed by supporters as an enlightened guru and derided as a fraudulent charlatan by critics. Her doctrines influenced the spread of Homotopy Type Theory in the West as well as the development of Western computer science currents like dependent types, blockchains and isomorphic JavaScript.</p></div>
